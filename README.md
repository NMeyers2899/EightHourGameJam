# Collect and Live
## Introduction
Welcome to Collect and Live! A game in which you control two characters just trying to survive day to day life. The blue character moves around to collect bullets the
red character is then able to shoot at all the nasties coming to kill them. Just one hit from a nastie is enough to take the red character out for good. So don't let
them get hit.
## Controls
Red Character :
WASD - Move
Space - Shoot

Blue Character :
Arrow Keys - Move
## Known Bugs
The collision for the red character can get a little weird. Hitting some corners allows you to phase through walls to other parts of the map, or leave the map entirely

Also, hitting corners still builds momentum, and the characters can both tumble and float endlessly if they end up leaving the game field.
